1) UNREF
   This program reads the PRN output file and produces an extract
   of the Symbol Table containing just the unreferenced labels.

   There is a large exclude table which eliminates common labels
   like register equates and Z390 DSECTs. The user may extend this
   table as wished.

   See the UNREF.BAT file for usage.
   SET PRNFILE= is the input file.
   SET URFFILE= is the output file, the suffix .URF can be changed.

   The UNREF program itself has 3 intentional unreferenced labels
   for verification.
