Z390 EXEC CICS Compatible Assembler Support

Z390 CICS compatible assembler application transaction manager support
has been developed by Melvyn Maltz and is distributed as open source
in the Z390\CICS directory.

The Z390 CICS compatible transaction manager includes a server
supporting multiple local and remote sessions connected via a TCP/IP
network. The transaction server can be started by running
CICS\Z390CICG.BAT which also starts local terminal sessions.

Remote clients can be started by running CICS\Z390KCPL.BAT for multiple
remotes or CICS\Z390KCPR.BAT for a single remote for tracing and testing.

The EZ390 runtime emulation TCPIO macro and SVC support for SOA client
server messaging is used to request CICS functions from the server and
to pass data and status back to the Client on a TCP/IP network.

Starting with V1.3.08h, the CICS compatible transaction manager supports
all VSAM base datasets for read and browse functions.

Starting with V1.4.02, Basic Mapping Support is included.

All the documentation included with each new release is in the cics\docs
directory as follows:

  Z390/CICS Readme for current version
  Z390/CICS History
  Z390/CICS Application Programming Guide
  Z390/CICS Basic Mapping Support
  Z390/CICS VSAM Guide
  Z390/CICS Supplied Transactions
  Z390/CICS Diagnosis Reference
  Z390/CICS System Programmers Guide
  Z390/CICS Sequential Terminal Guide

Z390 macro assembler and emulator support features supporting the above
CICS compatible transaction manager include the following:

   The MZ390 macro processor parses EXEC CICS statements and maps them
   into standard assembler macro calls. All the EXEC CICS support macros
   are in the CICS directory.

   The MZ390 macro processor replaces standard DFHRESP(error code)
   references with the corresponding standard fullword literal error
   code constant.

   The EZ390 runtime GUAM user interface dialog is used by each client
   to support TN3270 screen and keyboard I/O via TPUT with FULLSCR
   option and TGET with ASIS option for TN3270 standard data streams.
