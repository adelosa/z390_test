Z390/CICS VSAM Guide
====================

I recommend that the catalog and file structures are kept in a common
directory. More flexibility will be added if time permits.

Step 1:
Create and assemble a catalog and the files it is to contain using the
DEFINE macro.

The test files used in Z390\CICS are in the \cics\vsam directory, and
many more examples in \vsam\demo.

Multiple catalogs are supported.

Step 2:
Use REPRO to create the VSAM base cluster, paths and alternate indexes
as needed.

Step 3:
Add the FCT entries for your files to DFHFCTUS and assemble.

Step 4:
Add SET statements to Z390FILE.BAT to define the catalog and filename
that will be used at OPEN time.

VSAM Extensions
---------------

The following facilities are not supported in standard CICS/VSAM, but
they are in Z390/CICS VSAM.

a) Support of 4 gigabyte files and record sizes greater than 32K for all
   VSAM file types.

b) Skip-sequential access (browse) of an ESDS by RBA (fixed or variable),
   forward or backward.
   Note: Knowledge of the file will be necessary for variable ESDS in
         order to set the initial RBA.

VSAM limits
-----------

For KSDSs and AIXs, there is an internal limit on all keylengths of
128 bytes. Please raise an RPI if this is not sufficient for you.

Trademarks
----------
IBM, CICS and VSAM are registered trademarks of International Business
Machines Corporation.
