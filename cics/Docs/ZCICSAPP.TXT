Z390/CICS Application Programming Guide
=======================================

The EXEC CICS commands and parameters listed here are the only ones
currently supported in the Z390/CICS environment.

Differences between mainframe operation and Z390/CICS are explained.

For the operation of each command and parameter please refer to the
Manuals listed in the Reference section at the end of this document.

If you create your own Z390/CICS applications, it would be wise to
create a .BAT file that re-assembles them all in one go. The internal
interfaces are volatile at present and this will be a frequent
instruction.

The current Z390/CICS environment and all test programs can be
re-assembled using DFHALL.BAT. The test VSAM catalog and files can be
rebuilt using DFHALLV.BAT.

Assembly notes
--------------
CICS must be added as an option to CALL MZ390.
PROLOG and EPILOG are defaults.

NOEPILOG is supported but not fully tested, testing and correct usage
is scheduled for a future release of Z390/CICS.

PROLOG inserts the following:

  DFHEIGBL -- Defines the basic set of control block DSECTs.
  DFHEISTG -- Define the prefix areas of the Dynamic Storage Area (DSA).
  DFHEIEND -- Replaces the END statement and defines the end of the DSA.
  DFHEIENT -- Replaces the first CSECT statement
              Establish linkage and base registers
              GETMAIN the DSA
              Establish addressability to the EIB and TCTTE
              Some COMMAREA management

Other macros...
  DFHEIBLK -- EIB DSECT
  DFHEIRET -- Part of EXEC CICS RETURN
              Some clean-up operations
              FREEMAIN the DSA
              Manage link-level and return to last linker
  DFHPCT   -- Transaction definition
  DFHFCT   -- File definitions and options
  EXEC     -- Converts EXEC CICS statements into a unique macro call
              with a parameter list

Copy books...
   DFHAID     Standard CICS equates for AID keys
   DFHPCTUS   User transaction codes
   DFHFCTUS   User file definitions

Inclusion of the macro EQUREGS is mandatory.

Register Usage
--------------
R0   Reserved for internal use
R1   Reserved for internal use
R2   Reserved for internal use
R10  TCTTE address, must not be modified
R11  EIB address, must not be modified
R12  Default base register
R13  DSA address, must not be modified
R14  Reserved for internal use
R15  Reserved for internal use

Multiple base registers
-----------------------
The standard entry for a CICS program is as follows:

eg.
DFHEISTG DSECT
MYFIELD  DS    CL100              demo user field
...
MYPROG   CSECT

This standard method with the PROLOG option (default) will generate
a single code base of R12 and a single DSA base of R13.

If you want to extend the code base and/or the DSA base registers,
convert your code in line with the sample given, and include the
NOPROLOG option in CALL MZ390.

eg.
         DFHEIGBL
         DFHEISTG
MYFIELD  DS    CL100              demo user field
...
MYPROG   DFHEIENT CODEREG=(R8,R5),DATAREG=(R13,R6,R7)

Notes: You cannot override the first DATAREG value, it will always be R13
       ie. if you code DATAREG=(R6,R7) you will get DATAREG=(R13,R7).

       There is no cross-checking for register conflicts.

VSAM Notes
----------
See ZCICSVSM, Z390/CICS VSAM Guide for guidance in the setup of a
VSAM environment. This document also contains extensions to the VSAM
facilities currently available.

Supported EXEC CICS commands (detail by type)
---------------------------------------------
 1) General commands (02)

    a) HANDLE AID key(label) key etc.

       The following parameters are not supported...
          CLRPARTN, LIGHTPEN, OPERID, TRIGGER

       The manual is not clear about ANYKEY (no label). I have assumed
       that it clears all settings for CLEAR, PA and PF keys.

       label may take three forms:
          Direct reference
          Indirect reference
          Adcon literal

       eg. EXEC CICS HANDLE AID PA1(GOPA1) PA2(INDGOPA1) PA3(=A(GOPA1))
           ...
           GOPA1    DS 0H
           ...
           INDGOPA1 DC A(GOPA1)

       Errors
          BAD PARM
          HANDLE TYPE NOT RECOGNISED

    b) HANDLE CONDITION condition(label) condition etc.

       label may take three forms:
          Direct reference
          Indirect reference
          Adcon literal

          See HANDLE AID for examples of these forms.

       Errors
          BAD PARM
          HANDLE TYPE NOT RECOGNISED

    c) IGNORE CONDITION condition ...

       Notes:
          Ignoring an error may lead to unpredictable abends.

          INVREQ, PGMIDERR or ERROR by default...
             The EXEC CICS command treated as never existed.

          INVREQ on EXEC CICS RETURN will abend the task ASRA as I
          cannot ignore a RETURN.

          LENGERR or ERROR by default...
            NOHANDLE and any outstanding HANDLE AID will not invoke
            this condition.

       Errors
          BAD PARM
          IGNORE TYPE NOT RECOGNISED

    d) POP HANDLE

       For the HANDLE ABEND, a POP is the equivalent of a HANDLE ABEND
       RESET.

       Errors
          POP TYPE NOT RECOGNISED

       Conditions (RESP/RESP2)
          INVREQ/0

    e) PUSH HANDLE

       For the HANDLE ABEND, a PUSH is the equivalent of a HANDLE ABEND
       CANCEL.

       Errors
          PUSH TYPE NOT RECOGNISED

 2) Terminal Control (04)

    a) RECEIVE INTO(label) LENGTH(label) NOHANDLE

       INTO(label) and LENGTH(label) are mandatory.
       LENGTH must point to a 2-byte field.

       Although MAXLENGTH is not implemented yet, there is an internal
       maximum length set to the implied length of the INTO label.

       NOHANDLE is optional.

       Errors
          BAD PARM
          BOTH INTO AND LENGTH ARE REQUIRED
          LENGTH ERROR

       Conditions (RESP/RESP2)
          LENGERR/0

    b) SEND FROM(label) LENGTH()

       FROM(label) is mandatory.
          label may take three forms:
             Direct reference
             Indirect reference
             Adcon literal

       LENGTH
          Can be specified as LENGTH(value) or LENGTH(label)
          LENGTH(value) supports the use of the length attribute.
          label must point to a 2-byte hex value.

       Errors
          BAD PARM
          FROM IS MANDATORY
          LENGTH IS MANDATORY

 3) File Control (06)

    Notes:
       FLENGTH and XRBA are extensions, do not use these parameters
       if the source code is likely to be ported back to a mainframe
       environment.

       RBA access to a KSDS is not supported.

       DATASET is supported for legacy applications. It is noted that
       this parameter no longer appears in the Manuals.

       When conditions are raised as a result of a VSAM error, the
       RPL feedback codes (2nd and 4th bytes) are placed in EIBRCODE
       +1 and +2.

    a) READ FILE()/DATASET() INTO()/SET() LENGTH()/FLENGTH()
       RIDFLD() RBA/XRBA/RRN/GENERIC GTEQ/EQUAL KEYLENGTH()

       LENGTH
          Can be specified as a constant, literal or label.
          A constant must not exceed 32767.
          A literal or label must be 2 bytes and must not exceed 32767.

       FLENGTH
          Can be specified as a constant, literal or label.
          A constant must not exceed 2G-1.
          A literal or label must be 4 bytes and must not exceed 2G-1.

       LENGTH/FLENGTH notes:
          If not a label then ...
             If INTO is specified, then the length received is the
             implied length of INTO. This may raise the LENGERR
             condition if the data length is larger.

             If SET is specified, the complete record is returned and
             LENGERR cannot occur.

          If it is a label then ...
             If INTO or SET is specified, then it specifies the maximum data
             length that can be received. LENGERR can be raised if the
             data length is larger. The true data length is returned in
             label.

       KEYLENGTH
          Can be specified as a constant or label.
          A constant must not exceed 32767.

          Keylengths greater than 128 are ignored.

          The parameter is ignored for ESDS and RRDS.
          KEYLENGTH and GENERIC must be paired.

          If KEYLENGTH is zero by constant or label then parameters are
          changed internally:
             GENERIC/EQUAL or GENERIC/GTEQ
                Becomes KEYLENGTH(1) Key=X'00' GENERIC GTEQ

       RBA   RIDFLD has a 4-byte RBA
       XRBA  RIDFLD has an 8-byte RBA
       RRN   RIDFLD has a 4-byte relative record number

       GTEQ/EQUAL
          The parameter is ignored for ESDS and RRDS.

       GENERIC
          KEYLENGTH must be specified.

          changed internally:
             GENERIC/EQUAL or GENERIC/GTEQ
                Becomes KEYLENGTH(1) Key=X'00' GENERIC GTEQ
