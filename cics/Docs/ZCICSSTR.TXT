Z390/CICS Supplied Transactions
===============================

a) CEBR
   Browse Temporary Storage Queues.

   A new implementation of this transaction combines the old CEBR
   with CEMT I TSQ.

   The Temporary Storage queues are continuously updated/deleted, and
   therefore show only the state at the moment of request.

   A fixed state environment for testing CEBR may be obtained by
   running the test transaction BED9.

   Input formats:
      CEBR            Invokes the queue names display.
      CEBR qname      qname is case sensitive.
                      If found, goes to the data display.
      CEBR X'..'      The hex characters are not case sensitive.
                      A maximum of 16 hex characters are processed.
                      If found, goes to the data display.
         If the qname is not found, goes to the queue names display.

   There are two displays:
      a) The queue names display
         All current queue names are displayed with the number of
         items in each queue at that moment.

         There is only room for the 1st 60 queue names.

         PF2 switches the queue name format cyclically, EBCDIC/ASCII/HEX
         In hex mode, only the first eight bytes are shown.
         The current mode is shown top right.

         CLEAR will terminate CEBR

         Select a queue name with the cursor and press ENTER to go to
         the data display.

         Undisplayable characters are shown by a little square.

      b) The data display
         The 1st entry will show data items 1-16 or fewer starting
         from the 1st byte.

         Undisplayable characters are shown by a little square.

         Paging functions are usually by the PF keys shown at the
         bottom of the screen. These keys are dynamic, only those
         shown are active.

         PF keys:
            PF1 -- Displays available commands, these are explained
                   later. Any AID key returns to the data display.

            PF2 -- PF2 switches the data format cyclically,
                   EBCDIC/ASCII/HEX
                   The current mode is shown top right.
                   The queue name is also converted and in hex mode
                   only the 1st eight bytes are shown.

            PF3 -- Either terminates CEBR or returns to the queue names
                   display.

            PF4 -- 1st data item after ** TOP **

            PF5 -- Even if the ** BOTTOM ** line is on the screen,
                   PF5 will always display that line and as much
                   preceding data as is possible.

            PF7/PF8   -- Scroll forward or back 8 items.

            PF9/PF12  -- Scroll right or left 72 bytes if the mode is
                         EBCDIC or ASCII.
                         In hex mode, scrolling is 36 bytes.

            PF10/PF11 -- Scroll forward or back 16 items.

         Top line:
            REC n of n
               Shows the current item and maximum items.

            COL n of n
               Shows the current data position and the maximum available
               on the current display.

               If the data is of variable length, the display may show
               (eg) col 37 of 13. This may look odd, but indicates that
               a preset position and scroll forward or backward has
               displayed data that is too short for the preset position.
               Corrected by PF12 or a Column command.

         Commands:
            Typed after ENTER COMMAND ===>
            The minimum characters typed are indicated by upper case.
            In general, bad syntax causes the command to be ignored.
            There must be a space between parameters.

            Top         -- same as PF4
            Bottom      -- same as PF5
            Line n..n   -- Start from item number n..n
            Column n..n -- Show data from position n..n
            Find        -- Not yet implemented.

            Queue       -- Return to the queue names display
            Queue qname -- qname is case sensitive
                           Display data from qname
            Queue X'..' -- The hex characters are not case sensitive.
                        -- A maximum of 16 hex characters are processed.
               Any syntax error here returns to the queue names display.

            PURGE       -- Must be upper case, deletes the TS queue.

b) CEMT

   The commands shown below are the minimum abbreviations, the full
   text may also be typed, eg. CEMT INQUIRE TERMINAL

   CEMT I ENQ       Displays the QEA (ENQ) chain
                    Page forward/back not yet implemented.

   CEMT I FIL       Displays the FCT.
                    Page forward/back not yet implemented.

   CEMT I TER       Displays the state of all terminals.

   CEMT I TRA       Displays the PCT.
                    Page forward/back not yet implemented.

   CEMT I SYS       Displays the Z390CICS.INI file.
                    JAR_PATH and CICS_PATH are no longer INI parameters
                    so they are extracted from their environment
                    variables

   CEMT S TER OUT   Shuts down the terminal (Z390KCP).

   CEMT P SHU       Shut down the server if no active tasks.
                    When all active tasks are closed the server is
                    shut down and Z390/CICS ends.

   CEMT P SHU IMM   Shut down the server immediately.

   Conversational Mode
      If any syntax error occurs then CEMT is switched into
      conversational mode and all the above parameters can be cursor
      selected from the screen.

      You cannot retype the command here, cursor selection or CLEAR are
      the only options.

      The cursor may be placed anywhere on the selection line.
